Reeds and Shepp Curves in Python from Lavalle's C Implementation

The RS curves python codes are implemented in Python using the reference implementation by Lavalle [reference
 implementation by Lavalle](http://msl.cs.uiuc.edu/~lavalle/cs326a/rs.c). The details of the RS curve equations can be found in:

    }

We used this Python implementation to produce the curves in the following paper. The codes of the paper will be
 available in TierIV repositories. For the citations:
